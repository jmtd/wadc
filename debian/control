Description: programming environment for creating Doom maps
 WadC (Wad Compiler) is an Integrated Development Environment and
 functional programming language for developing Doom-engine maps.
 It can be used to generate complex levels which can be saved in
 Doom's WAD format.
 .
 The IDE includes a text-editor component; a debug output
 pane and a 2D drawing pane which previews the current
 script's output. Also included is an experimental command line
 interface, wadccli.
 .
 An external nodes builder (such as glbsp) is required before
 the resulting WAD file can be played by a doom-engine.
