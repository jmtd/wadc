current features, see link:reference.adoc[the Reference].

== Table of Contents

toc::[]

== Dev

Not yet released.

=== Language features

 * Two new built-ins: `getx` and `gety` return the cursor's current X/Y
   position.

=== Core program changes

 * Knobs: mark an expression with `knob(label,min,val,max)` to register
   a tweakable Knob in the UI, clamped within the range defined by the
   min and max parameters. Knobs can have their values adjusted in the
   "Knobs" tab pane in the main WadC GUI. The new value will take effect
   next time the Wad Language program is Run.

 * Random seed: In Prior WadC versions, the random number generator was
   re-seeded with the current time each time the Wad Language program was
   Run. As a result, repeatedly re-running a program which heavily relies
   upon RNG (such as `bsp.wl`) will not produce different results. To get
   the old behaviour, add a line like the following towards the beginning
   of your program:

       seed(rand(0,13371337))

 * The random seed at Run-time is exposed as a tweakable knob in the Knob UI.
 * The random seed at Run-time is written to the embedded `WADCSRC` lump as
   a comment prior to the program source. This is to help reproducibility.

==== Distribution and runtime requirements

WadC's minimum Java version, both as as source and run time dependency,
has moved to 16.

==== UI improvements

=== new/modified example programs

 * `vanilla_conveyor.wl`: simple demonstration of vanilla conveyors
 * `brexit.wl`: more complex demonstration of vanilla conveyors

==== Library additions/deletions

 * `vanilla_conveyor.h`: helper routines for building vanilla "conveyor"
    triggers, based on a discovery by Mikolah & Linguica on the Doomworld
    Forums. Experimental.

== 3.0

Released 20^th^ February 2019.

This version of WadC is dedicated to Lu (1972-2019). RIP.

=== Core program changes

 * When the external BSP program is invoked, we now instruct it to write out to
   a temporary filename, and then move that over the final WAD name. This means
   WadC can be used with node builders which do not support in-place node building
   (e.g. AJBSP and ZokumBSP).
 * One-sided lines now have their "impassable" flag bit set in PWADs.

==== UI improvements

The GUI now draws a marker for the cursor's location and orientation, in orange.
It can be toggled with the menus in the same way as drawing things or vertices.

=== Language features

 * `rand(x,y)` — returns a random integer between x and y (inclusive). The behaviour
    of `rand` is affected by the use of the `seed` function, in the same way as the
    choice operator.

 * `getorient` — returns the cursor's current orientation as an integer: 0 for North,
    1 for East, 2 for South, 3 for West.

 * Various deprecated functions have been removed: `landscape` and `marchingcubes`;
   as well as the functions formerly used for configuring WadC: `lastfile`, `doomexe`,
   `doomargs`, `bspcmd`, `iwad`, `twad1`, `twad2`, `twad3`, `togglevertices` and
   `togglethings`.

 * `setthingargs` is a renamed `setthinghexen` which has lost the thing type
   argument (just use `thingtype` instead) and has grown three extra parameters: Thing
   ID, Z-position and Thing Special.

=== new/modified example programs

* `blockmap.wl`: a random dungeon generator example. Room overdraw is avoided using
   a blocklist.
* `bsp.wl`: a simple example of a Binary Space Partition algorithm to subdivide a
   rectangular space into sub-spaces, e.g. as a random dungeon generator
* `hexen_ex.wl`: Added examples of z-height adjusted things

Various deprecated examples in `examples/old` have been removed.

==== Library additions/deletions

 * `deaf` has been deprecated.
 * `standard.h`:
     * `forXY`: a two-dimensional for loop
     * `assert`: test the parameter and die if ≠ 1
     * `north`/`east`/`south`/`west` constants, for use with `getorient`
     * `lessthan`, logical function
 * `list.h`:
     * renamed from `lisp.h`
     * add `in_list`, `list_length`, `list_remove` and `list_get` functions
 * `pair.h`: a pair data structure
 * `blockmap.h`: a blockmap data structure, based on pairs in tuples

=== Development stuff

 * Upgrade the version of `maven-assemble-plugin` that we rely on. This fixes building
   WadC with OpenJDK versions ≥ 9.

== 2.2

Released 13^th^ November 2017.

=== Core program changes

==== UI Look and Feel changes

As a side effect of other changes, the UI will possibly look and feel quite different,
depending on what platform you are using. On OS X, the menu is now integrated with the
OS menu at the top. Several extra keyboard shortcuts have been added.

On Linux, the new UI system (Swing) seemed to have terrible font rendering by default,
so WadC will try to enable font smoothing unless you explicitly configure the font
settings yourself by defining a `_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable containing a
definition of `useSystemAAFontSettings`, e.g. `useSystemAAFontSettings=off`.

==== No more configuration file

WadC no longer uses a `wadc.cfg` file to store preferences. The various language
built-ins for configuration are deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

Preferences are now stored using the
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html[Java
Preferences API]. What this means depends on what platform you are using; if you
want to inspect the preferences outside of WadC please consult the Java documentation
for more information.

If you want to read in the settings from an old `wadc.cfg` file, open it in WadC and
run it. The resulting preferences will be saved in the new system. You can then delete
the `wadc.cfg` file if you wish.

==== GUI preferences additions

WadC now features a Preferences GUI window that can be used to browse for and
set the Doom engine, BSP tool, etc.

You can also toggle the rendering of things or vertices and enable or disable a new
experimental fill-sectors feature from a new *View* menu. Sectors can be filled using
their floor height, ceiling height or light level values.

==== command-line interface

The command-line tool now reads in WadC's preferences. This means you can now
use it to build WADs that need `iwad` set correctly, such as those that compose
custom textures.

=== new example programs

* `birds.wl`: a complete map for Heretic, developed from scratch for Doomworld's
  "Heretic Upstart Mappers Project".
* `laby.wl`: a large, machine-generated script that generates a Labyrinth.
   Thanks to Yoruk for the contribution!

Several existing examples have been promoted out of `examples/old` into the
`examples/` folder.

=== Language features

`is_hexenformat`::   returns 1 if the map format is Hexen, 0 otherwise.
`simplex(x,y)`::     A simplex noise feature. Returns a random value between 0 and
                     1,000,000 from the X,Y coordinate into a 2D simplex "field".

The behaviour of `renderthings` and `renderverts` has changed slightly: they
now work with a global preference, rather than being something that is specific
to the current program. The language commands are also both deprecated and will
be removed in the next release (the preferences will remain)

==== Library additions/deletions

 * `lineflags.h` has been renamed `lines.h` and some line type definitions have been added.
 * `basic.h` addition: `cluster` - cluster 9 things together
 * `heretic/things.h` - various thing definitions have been added or renamed.
 * `math.h` has gained `even` and `odd`.
 * `standard.h` has gained `ifelse` and `if`: wrappers around the ternary operator
    which are possibly friendlier to use; `pradd` which behaves like a combination
    of `add` and `print`; useful when refactoring a program.
 * `thingflag.h` has gained `easyonly` and `mediumonly`.
 * `sectors.h` added with the beginnings of sector type definitions

==== Removed stuff

A whole load of deprecated (and undocumented) built-ins have been removed.

=== Bug fixes

 * The generalised sector helper in `boom.h` now correctly bit-shifts when
   the map is in Hexen (ZDoom) format.
 * the CLI tool now honours WadC preferences (in particular `iwad`).

== 2.1

Released 22^nd^ September 2016.

Version 2.1 of WadC is dedicated to the memory of Professor Seymour Papert
(1928-2016), co-inventor of the LOGO programming language.

=== Core program changes

 * Internationalisation support.
   * Partial french translation adapted from @nekrofage. Thanks!
 * The random seed is printed when you first execute a script. This
   means if something cool happens, you can make a note of the seed
   and reproduce it.
 * Stack traces are now divided by newlines rather than space characters.
 * It is now much more convenient to generate maps for the original Doom,
   Heretic, Hexen and Strife, in addition to Doom II.
 * The GUI now has basic undo/redo support for text editing.
 * The GUI's default size is now twice as large.
 * You can now write numbers in hexidecimal by prefixing them with '0x'.
   Only positive numbers are supported at the moment (use `mul(-1,0xabc)`
   as a workaround if you must)

=== Example scripts

 * `logo.wl`: draws the letters "WadC".
 * The "pipes" stuff in examples/beta continues to evolve and drive
   WadC development.
 * `doom_ex.wl`, `htic_ex.wl`, `hexen_ex.wl`, `strife.wl`: very simple
    test maps that demonstrate Doom #1/Heretic/Hexen/Strife support
 * `polyobj.wl`: example of Hexen polyobjects (swinging doors, etc.)
 * `boom.wl`: Examples of Boom generalised linedef and sector types.
 * `counter.wl`: a binary ripple counter for Boom
 * `2countrev.wl`: a modified `counter.wl`, showing how it might be
    used as part of a real map.

=== Documentation

 * The beginnings of a link:tutorial.adoc[proper tutorial].
 * A basic link:https://redmars.org/wadc/examples.html[gallery of WadC examples]
 * WAD files of the examples are periodically generated, nodes built and uploaded
   to <https://redmars.org/wadc/examples/>

=== Language features

`hexenformat`:: forces the output map to be in Hexen format (suitable for
                use with either Hexen or ZDoom)
`mapname`::     sets the map name to be generated. The default is `MAP01`.
                New libraries included in this release set sensible defaults
                for other doom-engine games.
`and`, `or`, `not`:: bitwise operators
`setthingflags`, `getthingflags`:: get and set the flags used for new things
`setlineflags`, `getlineflags`:: as above, but for lines
`thingangle`:: create a thing with a supplied angle value

==== Library additions/deletions

 * `water.h` has been enhanced so that you can manage multiple water-effects
   in the same map.
 * Some built-ins have been removed from the language and converted into
   WadC library routines: `deaf`, `easy`, `hurtmeplenty`, `ultraviolence`
   and `friendly` (see `thingflags.h`)
 * Angle constants have been added to `standard.h`: `angle_east`, `angle_ne`,
   `angle_north`, `angle_nw`, `angle_west`, `angle_sw`, `angle_south` and
   `angle_se`.

===== New libraries

`control.h`::  control sector management (broken out from `water.h`)
`doom.h`, `heretic.h`, `hexen.h`, `strife.h`:: sensible defaults and
       thing definitions for Doom (#1), Heretic, Hexen and Strife
`thingflags.h`:: Definitions for common flag values for all four games
                 as well as implementations of `deaf`, `easy`,
                 `hurtmeplenty`, `ultraviolence` and `friendly`.
`math.h`:: some mathematic routines (bit shifts and `pow` so far)
`boom.h`:: Routines for building Boom generalised linedefs and sectors,
           some constants for use with these routines.

=== Bug fixes

 * A long-standing bug with splitting lines has been fixed,
   where one line is drawn in the opposite direction to the
   first. When this happened you got the misleading error
   "Sidedef already assigned to sector". Various example maps
   had contortions to avoid this situation which now works.
 * You can now use `popsector` more than once. This means you
   can have an inner sector within an inner sector within an
   outer one, to an arbitrary depth.
 * `water.h` can now be used with inner-sectors and the water
    light level value is honoured.
 * `water.h` can be used to decorate the very first sector you
    draw.
 * The control sectors that `water.h` draws are now properly
   to the right of the cursor, rather than to the left, so it
   plays nicely with other `control.h` users.
 * The GUI is now listed as "WadC" rather than "MainFrame" in
   various places such as the Mac OS X menu bar.
 * If you use the choice operator before a `seed` operation,
   that seed value affected the choice operator when re-running
   the script.
 * You can freely mix `linetype` and `linetypehexen` in Zdoom
   Hexen-format maps. Previously, some of the argument flags set
   with `linetypehexen` were not cleared by `linetype`.
 * The tech-preview CLI will correctly embed the WadC source in
   generated WADs, just like the GUI.
 * The GUI code to write-out WadC files when you save has been
   changed to write UTF-8. Previously it was writing the first
   byte of UTF-8 only, so any multibyte characters were getting
   corrupted.

=== Development stuff

 * The tech-preview CLI has been renamed to WadCCLI.
 * WadC is now built using Maven. This has some implications:
 
  ** The source has all moved around and we have an obscene number
      of subdirectories. Sigh. There are a few convenience symlinks
      to make life easier.
  ** The program's version is now embedded as a property rather
      than being an auto-generated Java class.
 * There's a very hacky, experimental regression test suite in
   `tests/`.

== 2.0

Released 22^nd^ September 2015.

=== Core program changes

==== Distribution and runtime requirements

The WadC binary distribution is now a JAR file. On most platforms,
simply double-clicking on the JAR should launch the program. WadC
is no longer sensitive to the directory from which it is launched.

WadC now requires Java version 1.8 or newer to run or build. It has been
tested only with

* java version "1.8.0_45"
* javac 1.8.0_45

==== Sneak-peek: command-line interface

There is a very early-stages command-line interface now available. To
launch it, you need to run

    java -cp wadc.jar org.redmars.wadc.WadCC path/to/input.wl

It will attempt to parse, run and write out to path/to/output.wad. Be
aware that this is alpha quality, consider this a tech preview :)

==== configuration file syntax and location

wadc.cfg is no longer written/read from the current working directory. On
Windows, it's found at `%USERHOME%/.wadc/wadc.cfg`, on UNIX platforms it
looks in `$HOME/.wadc`. Examples

 c:\Users\Your Name\.wadc
 /Users/Jon/.wadc
 /home/you/.wadc

The configuration option `doomcmd` no longer exists. It has been replaced
with

`doomexe`::  path to your preferred doom executable
`doomargs`:: arguments to pass to your preferred doom executable, +
             separated by whitespace. This should end with '`-file`'.

The reason for this is to allow you to supply a `doomexe` containing
whitespace in the path.

If you have defined any of `twad1`, `twad2` or `twad3` in your
configuration, they will be added to the doom command line, immediately
after your `doomargs`, and before the path to the WAD you are building.

==== Embedded WadC code

WadC now writes out the source code for your level to the generated WAD
in a `WADCSRC` lump. Any locally included files are also included, but
standard library files (from within the Jar) are not.

If you define any new textures, WadC will write a `TEXTURE2` lump.  If you add
any patches to new textures which are not in your IWAD, A new `PNAMES` lump
will be generated and written. You need to have specified a path to an IWAD
file in your configuration for this to work.

=== Language features

`die(foo)`::   prints foo, then terminates.
`cat(a, b)`::  concatenates a and b
`seed(x)`::    seeds the random-number generator for reproducibility
`newtag`::     generate and return a new unique tag number
`texture`::    begins the definition of a new texture, to combine with `addpatch`
`addpatch`::   adds a patch to the currently defined texture
`deaf`::       `mute` has been renamed to `deaf`.
`getbot`, `getmid`, `gettop`, `getfloor`, `getceil`::    Accessor functions for the current texture or flat in use

==== Library additions

`list.h`::  lisp-style lists (broken out from `examples/lisp.wl`)
`water.h`:: Boom deep water tools

within `standard.h`:

 * `inc` and `dec`, convenient for increment/decrementing a variable
 * `fori` and `i`, the `for` loop but you can read the value of the iterator

==== New examples

`textures.wl`:: demonstrating the texture features
`llevels.wl`::  test WAD using texture features
`water.wl`::    demonstrating the Boom water helpers
"beta"::        directory containing my unfinished stuff

=== Bug fixes

Fix map view zooming with mouse clicks on non-Windows platforms.

The paths to the file you are editing, the corresponding generated WAD file,
your preferred Doom executable and any texture WADs you have defined can now
contain spaces or other special characters.
